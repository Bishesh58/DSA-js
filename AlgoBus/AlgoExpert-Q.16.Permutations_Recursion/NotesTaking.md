Prompt Understanding:
what is 'permutation': Definition
In mathematics, a permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word "permutation" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an ordered set.

array = [1,2,3]
after swap:
[3, 2, 1]

Solution#3:
swap:
const temp = array[0] = 1
let j = 2
assign 1st ele to array[j];
array[2] = temp => 1st ele =>'1'

help function is to get permutations

3 para: index, array, permutations
[1,2,3], permutations is an array of permuations elements

#104, check if index === last ele index or not
--> array.slice()
[1,2,3].slice() => copy of array
push the copy of array into permuatioms array

#105:
iterate the give array =[1,2,3]
from currentIndex = [0]
1st interation, i = 0 ,which is j
assign i to 'j'

#107:
swap positions:
array = [1,2,3]
at #107 line
when i =0; =j nothing happen
j+1
#108:
call recursive funcion
permutationHelper(0+1, [1,2,3], permutationsArray)

--> go back to #102
#106:
j=1; j++ => j =2
swap(1, 2, array)
i=1, j=2
array[i]=array[j]
2, 3
the array becomes
[3, 2]

backtrack switching numbers around recursively...;

#109:
swap:
swap()
