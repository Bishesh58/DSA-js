# Concept Overview:

- What is Stack?
- the principle of 'processing orders'
- 1] LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)

# Prompt Analysis and Problem Walkthrough:

- what is Min Max Stack?
  -> so, Min Max Stack not only we can do a.] peek(); b.] pop(); c.]push(ele);
  but also we can do d.] access the MinVal (using getMin() Method); and e.] access the MaxVal (using getMax() Method)

problem numbers sets:

e.g. 5, 7, 2
min 5, 7, 2
max 5, 7, 7
peek 5, 7, 2
